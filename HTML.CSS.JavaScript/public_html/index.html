    <p>Hello world. Here is a simple site containing most of my college Web Developement work. During these three courses I learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and a bit of PHP. Also, a lot of work is missing and/or very simple due to in class assignments being simple tasks which were graded on the spot. The photo was mandatory by the professor &#58;3</p>
    <h3>My Courses</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li><a href="comp1230/">COMP 1230</a> <p>Most of the work here is absent as I no longer could access my course file server to back up my work</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="comp1223/">COMP 1223</a>
        </li>
